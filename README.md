I read the paper. It's all about model compression. I learnt a lot and get to know how Deep neural networks pruning take place using batch normalization method.
The efficiency of eagleeye is 2 to 3% greater and having the lesser FLOPS than other pruning model out there.
There task is considered as searching problem 



I was struck in the getting the 'imagenet2012' imagenet dataset which is around 1.5gb which is a quite high for basic learning. 



here are some article to know about efficientnet
